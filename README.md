# Final Submission Work

/*
WE BOTH WORKED ON APPROACHES TO SEND/RECIEVE DUE TO MINIMAL COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES OVER BREAK (BOTH RETURNED HOME)
UPON RETURNING, WE BOTH PROGRESSIVELY WORKED TOGETHER DEBUGGING THE CODE SIDE-BY-SIDE TESTING DIFFERENT THINGS
UNTIL SOMETHING WORKED, THEN BOTH UPDATED THE SECTIONS AND CONTINUED DOING SO UNTIL GETING DONE WITH
SEND/REC/CLOSE. 

HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING TO OH WITH OTHER PROJECT DUE DATES ON TOP OF LAST MINUTE EXAMS/QUIZZES BEFORE FINALS WEEK
SO WE DID NOT HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF WHERE TO GO WITH SELECT
